# IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption (HELayers) SDK for Linux

Last year, we introduced FHE to Linux with our FHE Toolkit. Today, we are announcing the next evolution of the FHE Toolkit called IBM HElayers, a software development kit (SDK) for the practical and efficient execution of encrypted workloads using fully homomorphic encrypted data. HElayers enables application developers and data scientists to seamlessly use advanced privacy preserving techniques without having to be a specialist in cryptography - all while working in a newly integrated Python environment.Â 

HELayers is packaged as Docker containers that make it easier to get started and experimenting with FHE.  It is written in C++ and includes a Python API that enables data scientists and application developers to easily use the power of FHE by supporting a wide array of analytics such as linear regression, logistic regression, and neural networks.  

It is delivered as an open platform that is capable of using the latest FHE schemes and libraries for a given use case. HElayers currently ships with 15 tutorials and sample applications that highlight the basics of FHE and how to use this technology in a practical way. Sample applications include credit card fraud detection, encrypted database search, heart disease detection, image classification and more.  

In this repository is a script that you can run to install and run the pre-packaged SDKs, cpp or python, as a docker container.

     ./StartHELayers.sh 

If you are instead looking for the IBM Fully Homomorphic Encryption Toolkit for Linux README, it can be found [here](https://github.com/IBM/fhe-toolkit-linux/README_TOOLKIT.md).

### Try it for yourself

To run the script in this reposistory, clone the repo, open a Terminal and navigate to the root of this repo (`cd fhe-toolkit-linux/`).  

To run the Python HELayers:

     ./StartHELayers.sh python

For the C++ version:

     ./StartHELayers.sh cpp

The script will pull & download the latest version that works on your machine's architecture. It will run locally in its own container for you to view in your web browser.  The script will tell you where to point your browser to in the Terminal after completing the setup. The c++ version uses VSCode integrated into the browser for an IDE, and the python relies on a self-contained jupyter notebook.

To try HELayers out from Dockerhub directly, you can use these links below:

## Supported Configurations

At this time, the SDK supports many <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container" target="_blank">Docker</a> capable hosts such as most modern Linux distributions, macOS, <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_blank">Windows 10 Subsystem for Linux</a> and <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSLTBW_2.4.0/com.ibm.zos.v2r4.izso100/izso100_whatisintro.htm" target="_blank">z/OS Container Extensions</a>. Other host operating systems with recent Docker software may work as well but are untested.

## Feedback Survey
 
"IBM invites you to participate in our Advanced Security and Encryption Survey. This survey is designed to gather insights around the security challenges you or your organization face and better understand our users and serve you better. We will only use your feedback to improve the HELayers experience and inform future IBM security-focused products and services. IBM will not share your response data with any third parties. We look forward to your valuable feedback to improve the IBM FHE experience."
